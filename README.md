## Idea
Since I was little, I was reading books non-stop. Books became my oasis, my friends, my escape. My library was taken up all bookshelfs at my parent's place. Wjen I moved to Australia, I brought about 30 books with me, because you can't let friends go! 
These days I mostly read books on Kindle. With time I realized tat I can't remember what was the book about based only on the name of the book. I tried to use a book diery, a book Instagramm page, nothing worked. With this app, I can add the books I've read and add a note that will help me to remember what was the book about.
