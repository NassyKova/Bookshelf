I read a lot of books and find myself sometimes forgetting what was the book about. 
I am thinking about the app, where I can add books that will be stored as a library and I can add a note after reading. 
It also will have a "wish list" of books that I want to read.
- The app allows add books (Author: book name 1, book name 2)
- add/edit a comment to a book,
- read the note about the book
- check the added books, sorted by author
- move the book from the wish list to already read books list
